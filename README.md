Every item is User, User has fields like this – Name, Age, isStudent (boolean field)
Init isStudent = false for all users 

You should show the name, the age and the switcher/check box like the indicator if User is a student or not

Create Activity which shows Fragment and makes an internet request for fetch data.
Show fetched data in RecyclerView in any way you want – show us your UI/UX skill.
Instead of one Fragment create ViewPager with 2 tabs:
1.	First page is the same as Junior but with pagination (download more animals after reaching the end of the list) and the ability to mark animals as favorite – show STAR or any other icon which shows if Animal is favorite or not. After clicking on the icon, save it to favorites.
2.	Second Page shows all your favorites animals
Save all favorites in DB.
Save all data in DB for offline mode.
